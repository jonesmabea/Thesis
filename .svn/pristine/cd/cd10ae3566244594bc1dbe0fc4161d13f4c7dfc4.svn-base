\chapter*{Dedication and acknowledgements}
\begin{SingleSpace}
\initial{F}irst and foremost, I'd like to acknowledge God's hand throughout the Masters course and the wisdom provided by Him in various aspects. 
I'm extremely grateful to my supervisors, Dr. Luis Gonzalez and Dr. Raul Santos-Rodriguez who have offered indispensable  insight that has been truly beneficial to completing this project. In addition, I'd like to thank Dr. Sion Hannuna for providing me with necessary resources and advice. 
Of course, how can I forget the companionship of coffee throughout the draining coding and debugging periods. 


Most importantly, this project is dedicated to my parents, Zablon Mabea and Petronilla Mabea who have consistently and selflessly supported and encouraged me throughout my life.
