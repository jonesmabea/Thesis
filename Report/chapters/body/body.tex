\section{Separation of data into urban and non urban Context}

The KITTI Dataset contains annotated labels for the objects in training and testing images and pointclouds. However this annotation does not include if the image is from an urban or non-urban context. 
In order to do so it was necessary to find a way to annotate the images and pointclouds in terms of urban or non-urban context. 

\subsection{Visual examination}
 The first step was visual classification of the images into urban and non urban classes. 
 Depending on the  number of cars, vegetation, road 

\subsection{PointCloud classifier}
Once the training dataset was classified into to the different contexts. I was able to train a classifier to determine the context of a pointcloud input.
