Solid state lidar 


%Following the discussions in the previous chapters, it is clear that there is lack of transparency between industry and academic research on AVs. This can be explained by the industrial competition with companies trying to establish themselves as the leaders in development of AVs. However, I believe that for expedited development of AVs there needs to be more collaboration between these two communities. This will provide an overall benefit as it will prompt the development of standards and regulations. 
%
%With regard to LiDAR-based object detection, new advances in solid state technology has allowed for the development of cheap LiDAR units such as Quanergy's 250\$ unit.  This presents an opportunity for AV manufucturers to switch to these cheaper units with no fear of losing accuracy. 
%It is therefore my wish to implement my solution to be able to be used in solid-state LiDARs.
%
%In pursuing this project, I intend to engage in an exploratory investigation in order to establish various options in the implementation of the various tasks listed in chapter \ref{chap:proj_outline}. In doing so I will be able to provide an informed evaluation of the different factors affecting the development of AVs.  Furthermore, if time allows, the issue of lack of interpretibility of deep ;earning models will be explored. Determinism of the AV systems is an important aspect in terms of safety.
