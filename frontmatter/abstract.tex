\initial 
{T}he need for robust object detection in 3D point clouds has greatly increased with the ongoing push for autonomous vehicles(AVs). Most of these systems use Light Detection and Ranging(LiDAR), cameras or a combination of both in order to perform object detection \cite{ku2017joint}. LiDAR presents objects as point clouds in a 3D space thus offering critical shape information of objects in view. However, this representation is sparse and suffers from drawbacks such as occlusion. As a result, LiDAR-based detection performs poorly as compared to multimodal methods that have helped overcome this.\cite{zhou2017voxelnet}. However, multimodal methods are often complex to set up and synchronise \cite{ku2017joint} with the cost of components running into thousands of pounds. Furthermore, if one of the systems fails, the whole system would be rendered redundant. This can be catastrophic for self driving cars and therefore it is important to address this form of dependence.
